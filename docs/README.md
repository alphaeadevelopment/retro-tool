# Retrospective Tool

## About
Team retrospectives are an important aspect of agile delivery. Self-organising teams regularly review, adapt and correct
their process, sharing thoughts on what works well, what doesn't work so well and where improvements can be made.

For co-located teams, this can be done face-to-face in a room. However, most development teams will
have menbers working remotely, be it working from home, another office or another country entirely. In these situations,
retrospectives are commonly carried out on the phone over a conference line.

This tool seeks to ease some of the burdens and administrative over-head of conducting retrospectives for distributed
teams, as well as faciliting collection of ideas and focussing on the most relevant discussion points.

Team feedback can be rapidly captured through quick-to-setup questionnaires.
